            The Coalition to Organize and Mobilize Boston Against Trump (C.O.M.B.A.T.) is a grassroots, intersectional <br><br> coalition of
            students, artists and workers organizing to creatively resist all<br><br> forms of oppression and transform the policies, institutions

        <h2>Political Principles</h2>

        <div padding-left="20px">
            <h5>
            <li>
                We defend the self-determination of all indigenous nations. We stand against the ongoing assault on
                native lives and fundamental rights.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                We fight for Black power and Black liberation, and stand firmly against all forms of institutionalized anti-Black
                racism and colonization.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                We advocate for environmental justice, clean energy and a carbon negative economy.<br> We oppose our socio-economic
                dependence on fossil fuels and the brutal resource wars that result from that dependence.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                We fight for the protection, dignity and respect of immigrants and refugees on a state and federal level.<br>
                We advocate for the expansion of sanctuary campuses, cities and states to defend both <br> documented and undocumented
                individuals and families. We oppose deportations and xenophobia – no human being is illegal.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                We are an intersectional feminist organization that opposes all forms of patriarchal oppression.
                We respect the agency and bodily autonomy  <br>of women and gender nonconforming people who are affected by
                institutionalized misogyny.

            </li><br><br>
            <li>
                We fight for LGBTQ+ liberation. We center the struggle of gender nonconforming people, particularly trans<br>
                people and trans people of color. We reject all forms of institutionalized transphobia and homophobia.

            </li><br>

            <li>
                We fight for the protection, dignity and respect of Muslim people. We stand against Islamophobia, anti-Arab
                racism and the “war on terror,” which <br> is used as an ideological framework for the continued surveillance, repression,
                incarceration and torture of Muslim people.

            </li><br>

            <li>
                We defend the sovereignty of all oppressed nations and stand opposed to the imperialism <br> and neocolonialism
                perpetuated by global superpowers, especially the United States.

            </li><br>

            <li>
                We are committed to the social welfare and empowerment of all working class people internationally and
                intersectionally. We actively encourage the <br> continued growth and education of our coalition and the ongoing
                development of our principles.
